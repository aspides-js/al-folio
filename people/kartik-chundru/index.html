His research focuses on the genetics of rare developmental disorders. His current research focuses on the use of long-read RNA sequencing data, and other epigenomic data on developing brain, to improve burden testing methodology and deepen our understanding of the genetics underlying developmental disorders.</p> <p>Kartik has a background in physics, before undertaking a PhD at the University of Queensland in Australia where he worked on the genetics of DNA methylation. He went on to work at the Wellcome Sanger Institute where he began working on developmental disorders, leading an international collaboration studying recessive coding variation across large cohorts.</p> <p>&lt;!â€“ if you are unsure how to complete this, look here (https://github.com/aspides-js/aspides-js.github.io/blob/master/_people/nicholas-clifton.md?plain=1) for an example or you can slack jessica</p> </body></html>
